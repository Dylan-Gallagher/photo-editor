# Photo Editor
Command line photo editor written in C

## Overview
The simple photo editor can apply different effects to images (blur, grayscale, reflect, sepia) to BMP files

### Blur
To blur an image, run "./filter -b inputfile.bmp outputfile.bmp"

### Grayscale
To apply a grayscale filter (black and white), run "./filter -g inputfile.bmp outputfile.bmp"

### Reflect
To reflect the image on the y-axis (as if viewing it in a mirror), run "./filter -r inputfile.bmp outputfile.bmp"

### Sepia
To apply a sepia filter (gives it an older, brownish look), run "./filter -s inputfile.bmp outputfile.bmp"
